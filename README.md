PROJECTS
Project A: Implement a mathematical model of two biomolecules Baltimore, MD
Language: Python, Scope: Chemical computation, Timeframe: 2 weeks ,February 2024
This project implements a simplified mathematical model of interaction between two biomolecules. The model consists of two compartments, representing fast and slow dynamics for both bio-molecules. It provides a basic simulation of how these biomolecules concentrations change over time under normal
Project B : Crystal Structure Fundamental and Material Design,  Baltimore, MD
Language: Python, Scope: Chemical computation, Timeframe: 2 weeks, February-March 2024
Crystals are ordered materials characterized by a repeating arrangement of atoms within a unit cell, analogous to the bricks in a wall, where atoms sit at specific positions and can be substituted with other elements to create new materials. This structure is defined by a basis set of lattice vectors and atomic positions, essential for designing novel materials through computational methods by altering atomic sites, as exemplified by the potential substitution of nitrogen with carbon in a unit cell
Project C: Stability and Fix Points in Population Model,  Baltimore, MD
Language:Julia, Scope: Dynamical Systems,Timeframe: 2 weeks , February 2024
I created a Bifurcation plot in order to map out the pitchfork to indicate the critical points in a predator prey model.
Project D: Damping,  Baltimore, MD
Language:Julia, Scope: Dynamical Systems, Timeframe: 1 weeks , February-March 2024
I created a vector field plot to show different types of damping.
Project E: Bifurcation Plots,  Baltimore, MD
Language:Julia, Scope: Dynamical Systems,Timeframe: 2 weeks ,  March 2024
I created bifurcations to classify critical points in 2D, using continuous and discrete values and seeing in what value r and x, it changes the behavior of the function. I created the 3D model of saddle points and a way to classify critical points in 3D.
Project F: Convex Polygon Collisions ,  Baltimore, MD
Language:Python, Scope: Collision Modeling: ,Timeframe: 3 weeks ,  March- April 2024
I created an engine that uses objects like circles or polygons to morph or interact with other objects during gameplay. This 2D engine is used to create and modify convex polygon objects. 
Project G: C02 fluxes, Baltimore, MD
Language: Python, Scope: C02 precedictive and regression modeling, Timeframe:3 weeks, April 2024
This project aims to analyze data from the Harvard Forest to understand better the seasonal and yearly variations in CO2 fluxes and to model these fluxes based on various environmental conditions. By utilizing regression models to correlate CO2 flux with environmental variables like radiation, temperature, and wind, the project seeks to predict CO2 fluxes and fill data gaps. The analysis will include tasks such as visualizing data trends, identifying missing data, and evaluating the impact of environmental factors on CO2 dynamics. The insights gained will contribute to the broader scientific understanding of carbon-climate feedback mechanisms and help predict future changes in forest carbon sequestration capabilities.
